# Lyme_Rates_Analysis
Lyme disease is a tick-borne infection caused by the Borrelia burgdorferi. Incidence of Lyme disease have been increasing across the continental US, particularly in the Northeast. You have been given a dataset from the CDC of Lyme disease infection rates( number of positive cases) per 100,000 people by state.
I compared the probability of infection for Alaska between 2008 and 2016
